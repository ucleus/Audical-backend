# Product Guidelines - Medical Equipment Marketplace Backend

## 📝 Tone & Voice
- **Professional & Authoritative:** Use clinical and technical terminology consistently. Prioritize precision and clarity over conversational language. The interface should instill confidence in the accuracy of the data being managed.

## 🎨 Visual Identity & UI Principles
- **Visual-First Presentation:** Prioritize high-quality image galleries for equipment listings. Use prominent badges for equipment condition and status. Organize dense technical specifications into logical sections (tabs or accordions) to maintain a clean, uncluttered interface.
- **High-Contrast Light Theme:** Use a clean, professional light theme that meets WCAG standards for color contrast to ensure maximum readability and reduced eye strain during long data-entry sessions.

## ⌨️ Interaction Design & Forms
- **Efficiency & Speed:** Optimize for power users with logical tab ordering, keyboard shortcuts for common actions, and bulk editing capabilities for inventory management.
- **Error Prevention & Recovery:** Implement robust real-time validation, clear error messaging, and "Are you sure?" confirmations for destructive actions like deleting a listing.
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Group complex equipment metadata into logical categories (General, Technical, Compliance, Shipping) to prevent user overwhelm and improve form completion rates.
- **Smart Defaults:** Utilize intelligent defaults for fields like currency, units of measurement, and location based on user profile settings to minimize repetitive data entry.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy UX
- **Transparent Security:** Provide users with clear visibility into system security. Display "Last Login" timestamps, active session management, and access to detailed audit logs for listing changes to ensure accountability and trust.

## ♿ Accessibility Standards
- **Universal Access:** Commit to a fully accessible administrative interface.
  - **Keyboard Navigability:** All functions must be accessible via keyboard.
  - **Screen Reader Support:** Use semantic HTML and comprehensive ARIA labels.
  - **Responsive & Scalable:** Ensure the UI remains functional and legible at varying zoom levels and screen sizes.
